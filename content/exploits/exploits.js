const exploitData=[{name:"Securly IndexedDB Exploit",difficulty:"Easy",overview:'Honestly this is the stupidest exploit I’ve found. I found it while digging around chrome urls and figured out that Securly uses IndexedDB for storing websites that should be blocked.\n\nTO DO THIS YOU NEED:\n- Access to chrome://indexeddb-internals\n- A blocking extension that uses IndexedDB (e.g., Securly)\n\nSteps:\n1. Go to chrome://indexeddb-internals\n2. Scroll down till you see chrome-extension://(Securly extension ID)\n\nTypical IDs:\n- joflmkccibkooplaeoinecjbmdebglab\n- iheobagjkfklnlikgihanlhcddjoihkg\n- ckecmkbnoanpgplccmnoikfmpcdladkc\n\n3. Click "Force Close"\n4. And boom — no more blocked websites!\n\n(To disable this exploit simply restart or turn on and off your device)\n\nSecurly may kick back in after a while, but you can just force close again.\n\nEXTENSIONS CURRENTLY WORKING:\n- Securly\n\nEXTENSIONS NOT WORKING:\n- GoGuardian\n- Lightspeed\n- Linewize\n- Blocksi\n- iBoss\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: “The Securly extension ID you gave isn’t there”:\nA: Go to chrome://extensions → Click on Securly → Check the ID → Recheck chrome://indexeddb-internals. If it’s still missing, this may have been patched.'},{name:"Crimson",difficulty:"Extremely Difficult/Requires Expertise",overview:'I wanted to share it with more people!\nI added some of my own stuff to make it work better but most of it was copyed from ext-remover.\n\n1) Esc+Refresh+Power and re-enroll (Enter recovery page), or you can just powerwash. (alternatively, you can push on the little arrow next to your name, and push "remove user")\n\n2) Log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off WiFi \n\n3) Go to chrome://extensions, turn on WiFi, and wait for your school’s blocking extension to appear.\n\n4) As soon as it appears, turn off WiFi and restart as fast as possible. (if this does not work for you, try waiting a second or two, I found this to work better)\n\n5) Log back in, go back to extensions, and wait. If it says your blocking extension could be corrupted, then it worked (wait at least a minute with a close watch in case it comes back)\n\n6) If it didn’t work, start over. You have to be fast, if it didn\'t show up as corupted,  it means the extension has not been downloaded yet, repeat steps 3 and 4.'},{name:"Extension Webview",difficulty:"Medium",overview:"This will only work if chrome://kill or chrome://crash isn’t blocked by policy and yes I know that this chrome://kill method is already known\n\n1.
