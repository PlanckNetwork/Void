**Void** is a modular game framework that dynamically builds its core gameplay from an import list. This list serves as a registry of game modules, allowing Void to initialize and manage a flexible `gameArray`. Each imported module can define its own behaviors, objects, or scenes, which are then pushed into the central array to power gameplay. This makes expanding or modifying the game as simple as updating the import list—perfect for scalable development and experimentation.
